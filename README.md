## Psychology Research Projects

Here is the summary of research projects I have done since college. 

Using [Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Studies (FFCWS)](https://ffcws.princeton.edu/about) of over 2,000 children and their caregivers from underserved communities in the United States, I analyzed the data of parent-child interactions and child language outcomes from age 3 to age 5 in SPSS and R with advanced statistical methods.

### Summer Science Research Fellowship
During my Summer Science Research Fellowship, I conducted preliminary studies that underscored the critical role of parent-child interaction in fostering language development in children. Our research focused on the longitudinal effects of caregiver depression on early language skills and how this relationship was mediated by parental responsiveness. Through correlational analyses, we demonstrated that parental responsiveness significantly predicts child language development, highlighting the pivotal influence of caregivers on children’s cognitive growth.


### Thesis Project
Building on these findings and recognizing the importance of the home environment, I explored additional aspects of parenting behaviors. My thesis project examined bidirectional longitudinal correlations between caregiver cognitive stimulation and child language development. Specifically, I investigated how cognitively stimulating activities—such as reading books, telling stories, and playing with toys featuring different shapes or colors—affect children's cognitive growth over time. Language skills at ages 3 and 5 served as indicators of cognitive development, as these ages represent critical periods for receptive and expressive vocabulary acquisition.

Using a dataset collected from 2,410 children and their caregivers from low-income and racially diverse families in the United States, I conducted independent research to investigate the correlations between changes in cognitive stimulation and child language skills. By employing the bivariate latent change score model in R, we found that the latent changes in cognitive stimulation and child language development were negatively associated with the initial levels of both variables respectively. Specifically, children with lower starting levels of language skills showed greater improvements in their language outcomes at age 5. When analyzing covariates, I identified household income and parental education level as direct predictors of early language skills. These findings suggest that children from underserved communities require additional support and emphasize the importance of exploring other factors that could mitigate the adverse effects of limited resources and lack of empathetic companionship.
