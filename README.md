Psychology Research Projects

Here is the summary of research projects I have done since college. 

Using [Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Studies (FFCWS)](https://ffcws.princeton.edu/about) of over 2,000 children and their caregivers from underserved communities in the United States, I analyzed the data of parent-child interactions and child language outcomes from age 3 to age 5 in SPSS and R with advanced statistical methods.
