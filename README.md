Psychology Research Projects

Here is research projects I have done since college. 

Using Future of Families and Child Wellbeing Studies (FFCWS) of over 2,000 children and their caregivers from underserved communities in the United States, I analyzed the data of parent-child interactions and child language outcomes from age 3 to age 5 in SPSS and R with advanced statistical methods.
